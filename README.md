## Introduction
[Game Title Placeholder] is an API-driven game that challenges players to combine their programming skills and data science knowledge to optimize resource production and allocation. 
The game operates on API endpoints. The user creates a authorisation token, and uses that token as their “account” key. They can then access different endpoints which perform different actions.
The game is an MMO where users create and develop programs to navigate dynamic terrain, gather resources, and combat enemies to earn additional resources and gear. Success in the game relies on strategic coding, algorithmic thinking, and efficient resource management as players compete against others in an ever-evolving environment.

## Target Audience
The game is designed for a wide range of programmers, from beginners to advanced developers. Our goal is to spark interest in programming for newcomers while offering seasoned programmers a challenging and rewarding experience. By catering to different skill levels, the game provides learning opportunities, fosters problem-solving skills, and pushes experienced players to optimize their solutions and compete at higher levels.

## Additional Details
The progress of all players will be reset every [Insert Time Here] months. This periodic reset ensures that players continually develop new strategies and prevents them from relying solely on previously successful tactics.
